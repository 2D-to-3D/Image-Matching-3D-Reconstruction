# Image Matching and 3D Reconstruction with COLMAP

This repository contains Python code for image matching, feature detection, and 3D reconstruction using [COLMAP](https://colmap.github.io/), a popular computer vision toolkit. It includes scripts to process image datasets, match features, and generate 3D reconstructions. The code is intended to be used in computer vision and 3D reconstruction tasks.

## Features

- Shortlist image pairs for feature matching based on similarity.
- Detect and match local features using different algorithms, including DISK, KeyNetAffNetHardNet, and LoFTR.
- Generate 3D reconstructions using COLMAP.
- Create a submission file with 3D camera poses for image datasets.
